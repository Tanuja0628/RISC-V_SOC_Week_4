# RISC-V_SOC_Week_4
This repository speaks about my understanding of Week 4 concepts of India's RISC V Chip Tapeout program of Cmos design and spice simulations.

## Week 4 Overview
The 5 days of Week 4 just had a roller coaster of fundamentals of Mos transistor basics and its spice simulations followed by Complementary Mos characteristics and its Robustness evaluations

- Day 1 contents mainly focuses on basics of MOSFET such as channel effects threshold voltage, channel inversion etc. with intro to Spice simulations
- Day 2 dwelved into the velocity saturation and CMOS Inverter Voltage Transfer Characteristics
- Day 3 talks about the switching threshold voltage and carried in with dynamic simulations
- Day 4 starts with Robustness evaluation with Noise Margin calculation
- Day 5 completes with Robustness evaluation using supply and device variations
